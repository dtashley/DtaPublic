\chapter{Preface}

TBD.

%The product described in this document, the 
%\emph{\productbasenamelong{} Version \productversion{}}
%(identified more compactly as 
%\emph{\productbasenameshort{}-\productversion{}}\footnote{Mnemonic:
%\emph{microcontroller} is often abbreviated \emph{uC} or $\mu$\emph{C}, hence the
%loose acronym \emph{\productbasenameshort{}} for \emph{\productbasenamelong{}}.}),
%is an open-source utility library for inexpensive microcontrollers
%and microprocessors.
%
%The functions provided in \emph{\productbasenameshort{}} fall into these categories:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Arithmetic.
%\item Bounded arithmetic.
%\item Fixed-point arithmetic.
%\item Large-operand and extended-precision arithmetic.
%\item Block memory operations.
%\item Bit-mapped set functions.
%\item Searching.
%\item Sorting.
%\item Array manipulation.
%\item Linear filters.
%\item Non-linear filters.
%\item Vertical counters.
%\item Control system components.
%\item CRC, checksums, and non-cryptographic hashes.
%\item Cryptographic hashes.
%\item Ciphers.
%\item Miscellaneous functions.
%\item Utility functions.
%\item Speed-enhanced development tool replacement functions.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{\productbasenameshort{}-\productversion{}}
%is packaged as two libraries, each with
%a different purpose:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The \index{general library}``general library'' contains functions not normally provided
%      with development tools.  The general library is described by
%      every chapter in this document except Chapter \ref{csef0}.
%\item The \index{replacement library}``replacement library'' contains
%      speed-enhanced replacements
%      for functions packaged with development tools, in those cases
%      where some optimization could be performed or where an alternate
%      and faster algorithm is known.  The replacement library is covered by 
%      Chapter \ref{csef0}.  Functions in the replacement library
%      generally are designed to boost speed at the expense of program
%      memory and/or RAM\@.  Use of the replacement library is optional.
%      The replacement library may not exist for all platforms.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{\textbf{Part I: General Information}} provides introductory
%and general information about \emph{\productbasenameshort{}}.
%
%\begin{itemize}

%      a restricted range.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cfpa0}: Fixed-Point Arithmetic Functions}}
%      documents arithmetic functions that use representions of rational or real
%      numbers as integers with the radix point shifted to the left or right.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{claf0}: Large-Operand and Extended-Precision Arithmetic Functions}}
%      documents functions that perform arithmetic on operands
%      larger than are natively handled by the machine or the compiler; or
%      calculate with extended precision.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cbmf0}: Block Memory Functions}}
%      documents functions that operate on blocks of memory
%      (setting, copying, shifting, etc.).
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cbsf0}: Bit-Mapped Set Functions}}
%      documents functions that operate on sets represented
%      as arrays of bits.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{csea0}: Search Functions}}
%      documents functions that perform searches; such as linear searches
%      and binary searches.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{csol0}: Sort Functions}}
%      documents functions re-order arrays.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cami0}: Array Manipulation Functions}}

%      documents functions that implement vertical counters.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{ccso0}: Control System Components}}
%      documents functions that implement control system components such as 
%      integrators and differentiators.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{ccrc0}: CRC, Checksum, and Non-Cryptographic Hash Functions}}
%      documents functions that calculate and manipulate
%      CRCs, checksums, and non-cryptographic hashes.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{ccrh0}: Cryptographic Hash Functions}}
%      documents functions that implement cryptographic hashes.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{ccip0}: Cipher Functions}}
%      documents functions that encrypt and decrypt data.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cmsc0}: Miscellaneous Functions}}
%      documents functions that implement well-defined mappings but could not
%      be easily classified elsewhere.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cnef0}: Utility Functions}}
%      documents functions that provide useful non-data-driven
%      functionality.
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{csef0}: Speed-Enhanced Development Tool Replacement Functions}}
%      documents functions that may optionally be used to 
%      boost the speed of the functions packaged with the development tool suite.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{\textbf{Part III: Technical Background}} provides 
%ancillary technical information useful in understanding
%the library.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{ctbg0}: Technical Background}}
%      provides technical background on a variety of miscellaneous
%      topics where the amount of material to be presented
%      is small (i.e. a full chapter is not required).
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{crla1}: Rational Linear Approximation}}
%      provides background and algorithms surrounding approximating
%      a function $f(x) = r_I x$ [where $r_I \in\vworkrealsetnonneg$]
%      by a function 
%      $g(x) = \lfloor hx/k \rfloor$ (where
%      $h, k \in \vworkintsetnonneg$)\@.
%      Choosing $h$ and $k$ so as to place
%      $r_A = h/k$ as close as possible to $r_I$ 
%      subject to the constraints of a processor's
%      typical integer multiplication and division instructions is not a trivial
%      problem, and the necessary results from number theory
%      are presented.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{\textbf{Part IV: Developer Information}} provides 
%information about building the library from source code and
%extending the library.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cbpc0}: \productbasenameshort{} Build Procedures}}
%      documents how \emph{\productbasenameshort{}}
%      is built from source code.
%\end{itemize}
%
%%\emph{\textbf{Part V: Procedures and Checklists}} provides 
%%procedures and checklists for tasks where the procedure or
%%checklist did not naturally fit into a different section
%%of this document.
%%
%%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item \emph{\textbf{Chapter \ref{cpck0}: Procedures and Checklists}}
%%      defines procedures and checklists that aren't most naturally
%%      placed elsewhere in this document.
%%\end{itemize}
%
%\emph{\textbf{Part V: Appendices, Bibliography, and Index}} provides
%glossaries, references, and an index.
%Individuals, products, companies, websites, and Internet newsgroups
%are cited in the same framework
%as traditional references in order to provide the reader with more
%resources to obtain information.
