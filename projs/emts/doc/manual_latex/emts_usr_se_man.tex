%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%These are my notes on various LaTeX tips and tricks.  Some are due to helpful posters at
%comp.text.tex, and some are from the LaTeX FAQ at texfaq.org.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%My Section Title is Too Wide for the Page Header
%------------------------------------------------
%By default, LaTeX sectioning commands make the chapter or section title available for use by page
%headers and the like. Page headers operate in a rather constrained area, and it’s common for
%titles too be too big to fit: the LaTeX sectioning commands therefore take an optional argument:
%
%   \section[short title]{full title}
%
%If the ‹short title› is present, it is used both for the table of contents and for the page
%heading. The usual answer to people who complain that their title is too big for the running head
%is to suggest that they the optional argument.
%
%However, using the same text for the table of contents as for the running head may also be
%unsatisfactory: if your chapter titles are seriously long (like those of a Victorian novel), a
%valid and rational scheme is to have a shortened table of contents entry, and a really terse entry
%in the running head.
%
%One of the problems is the tendency of page headings to be set in capitals (which take up more
%space); so why not set headings as written for “ordinary” reading? It’s not possible to do so
%with unmodified LaTeX, but the fancyhdr package provides a command \nouppercase for use in its
%header (and footer) lines to suppress LaTeX’s uppercasing tendencies. Classes in the KOMA-script
%bundle don’t uppercase in the first place.
%
%In fact, the sectioning commands use “mark” commands to pass information to the page headers.
%For example, \chapter uses \chaptermark, \section uses \sectionmark, and so on. With this
%knowledge, one can achieve a three-layer structure for chapters:
%
%\chapter[middling version]{verbose version}
%\chaptermark{terse version}
%which should supply the needs of every taste.
%
%Chapters, however, have it easy: hardly any book design puts a page header on a chapter start
%page. In the case of sections, one has typically to take account of the nature of the \*mark
%commands: the thing that goes in the heading is the first mark on the page (or, failing any mark,
%the last mark on any previous page). As a result the recipe for sections is more tiresome:
%
%\section[middling version]{verbose version%
%              \sectionmark{terse version}}
%\sectionmark{terse version}
%
%(the first \sectionmark deals with the header of the page the \section command falls on, and the
%second deal with subsequent pages; note that here, you need the optional argument to \section,
%even if “middling version” is in fact the same text as “long version”.)
%
%A similar arrangement is necessary even for chapters if the class you’re using is odd enough that
%it puts a page header on a chapter’s opening page.
%
%Note that the titlesec package manages the running heads in a completely different fashion; for
%example, you can use the optional argument of sectioning commands for page headers, only, by
%loading the package as:
%
%\usepackage[toctitles]{titlesec}
%
%The package documentation offers other useful techniques in this area.
%
%The memoir class avoids all the silliness by providing an extra optional argument for chapter
%and sectioning commands, for example:
%
%\section[middling version][terse version]{verbose version}
%
%As a result, it is always possible for users of memoir to tailor the header text to fit, with very
%little trouble.
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%The ten special characters used only for LaTeX commands are:
%   #   $   %   &   ~   _   ^   \   {  }
%
%Any sequence of space characters handled the same as a single space.
%
%Blank line interpreted as the end of a paragraph.
%
%TeX interprets ` ' as the single quotes, `` and '' as the double quiotes.
%
%Three single quotes in a row is ambiguous.  To resolve the ambiguity, use \, which tells TeX to
%insert a small space.  Example:  ``\,`Fi' or `fum?'\,'' he asked.
%
%- is the hyphen.  Example:  X-ray.
%
%-- is the medium dash for number ranges.  Example 1--2.
%
%--- is the punctuation dash, to separate thoughts.
%
%You tell TeX that a period does not end a sentence by using "\ ".  Example:  Tinker et al.\ made
%the double play.  (It doesn't matter how many spaces are AFTER the \, but there must be no space
%between the period and the \.
%
%When a sentence-ending period follows an uppercase letter, you have to tell TeX that the period
%ends the sentence.  Precede the period iwth \@.
%Example:  The Romans wrote I + I = II\@.  Really!
%
%In the case of a period coming before a closing paren, LaTeX also needs guidance.
%Example:  Beans (lime, etc.)\ have vitamin B\@.
%
%Same situation for ?, !, :, as for period, unless it follows an uppercase letter.
%
%Can produce the special symbols, \$ \& \% \_ \{ \} easily.
%
%Can use \TeX and \LaTeX.
%
%\today inserts the compilation date.
%
%\ldots produces an ellipsis.
%
%Can place "\ " after a command to add whitespace.  (I've found that {} also works, but I'm not
%sure if that is a correct approach.
%
%\emph{} emphasizes text.  Can be nested.
%
%Using the tilde prevents inter-word breaks.  Example:  Mr.~Jones
%
%\mbox{} prevents a line break in a word.  Example:  Dr. \mbox{Lamport}, I presume?
%
%\footnote{}.
%
%\footnote{} cannot be used in the argument of most commands.  Can't be in \mbox{}, for example.
%
%\( and \) delineate formulas.  But $ works, too.  So does \begin{math} and \end{math}.
%
%_ produces subscripts.  ^produces superscripts.
%
%In a mathematical formula, ' produces a "prime", '' a double-prime, and so on.
%
%The % character is for comments, but also acts as a continuation character.
%
%\documentclass{} indicates which document class will be used, article, etc.
%
%Example:  \documentclass[twocolumn,12pt]{article}
%The options in square brackets are optional.
%
%\usepackage{}
%
%The standard packages have these sectioning commands:
%   \part
%   \chapter
%   \section
%   \subsection
%   \subsubsection
%   \paragraph
%   \subparagraph
%
%There are restrictions on the ordering---\subsection must have a preceding section---but
%\part is optional.
%
%\appendix command causes appropriate numbering for an appendix.
%
%Fragile commands.  \protect right before fragile command.
%
%Commands that are not fragile are called "robust".
%
%\protect normally can't hurt, so it is safe to use if you're not sure if a command is fragile.
%
%\begin{quote}, \end{quote}
%
%This is called a LaTeX environment.
%
%quotation environment used for quotes of more than one paragraph.
%
%itemize, enumerate, and description, and can be nested.  In description, there is an optional
%argument which is the item name.
%
%All commands that have an optional argument are fragile.
%
%verse environment for poetry.
%
%\\ used to demarcate stanzas.  \\* is the same but prevents starting a new page at that point.
%
%equation environment--numbered equations.
%
%displaymath environment--same as equation, but no number.
%
%\em command causes LaTeX to start emphasizing text.  Scope of such a command is ended by
%\end or by a } where matching \begin or { precedes the declaration.
%
%{\em that} is legal.
%
%Every declaration has a match environment of the same name, i.e. \begin{em} and \end{em}.
%
%Everything LaTeX writes to the screen is also mirrored to the log file.
%
%Some error messages are detected by LaTeX, others by TeX.  The LaTeX errors are preceded by
%! LaTeX Error:
%
%Line break on TeX error messages indicates position within line of the detected error.
%
%You can type X followed by <RETURN> to stop LaTeX before it is finished.
%
%\batchmode at the beginning of the input file causes LaTex to write to the log file only, and
%continue on all errors.
%
%In the summary, the notion of "moving argument" is described.  Never seen this before.  In
%this case, \protect is required.
%
%Type style is characterized by shape, series, and family.
%   Shape
%      \textup{}
%      \textit{}
%      \textsl{}
%      \textsc{}
%
%   Series
%      \textmd{}
%      \textbf{}
%
%   Family
%      \textrm{}
%      \textsf{}
%      \texttt{}
%
%Can be combined to create a variety of styles.
%
%Each has a corresponding declaration.
%
%The commands can be used in math mode to put text into a formula.  (The declarations cannot
%be used).
%
%These type styles define a visual property.  You want logical rather than visual properties in
%your text.  Better to define your own styles so you specify in terms of logical rather than
%visual.
%
%There are ways to produce foreign language symbols (umlauts, various accent marks), Section 3.2
%of Lamport's book.
%
%Math mode is covered in Section 3.3.
%
%The amsmath package is recommended by Lamport if you do anything complex.
%
%\newcommand is covered in Section 3.4.
%
%\ensuremath
%
%\renewcommand
%
%\newenvironment
%
%\renewenvironment
%
%\newtheorem
%
%Section 3.5, Figures and other floating bodies.
%
%Two floating bodies:  figures and tables.
%
%\caption command (moving argument, fragile).
%
%Anything can go in the body of a figure or table--LaTeX processes it in paragraph mode just like
%any other text.
%
%Simple pictures can be drawn directly.  There is also the figure environment.
%
%Section 3.5.2--Marginal Notes--want to stay away from those because of past problems.
%
%Tabbing and tabular environments.
%
%Section 3.7--Simulating Typed Text
%
%\tt family.
%
%verbatim environment.  Honors spaces.  Allows the reserved characters.
%
%\verb command simulates a short piece of typed text inside an ordinary paragraph.  Separated
%by ordinary characters.
%
%There are also verbatim* and verb* environments.  They are the same except they have a special
%marker for whitespace.
%
%\label and \ref.
%
%Should get in the habit of using the tilde between Equation and the reference, i.e.
%Equation~\ref{}.  The same for Section, if ever used.
%
%\label{} must go after \caption{} in table or figure.
%
%Within a table or figure, \caption acts like a sectioning command.  In fact, tables
%and figures may both have multiple captions (although DTA believes this is almost never done).
%
%\pageref{}.
%
%A \label may occur in the argument of a sectioning or \caption command, but in no other
%moving argument.
%
%"latex lablst" will allow you to list the labels in a LaTeX document.
%
%\cite, again preceded by ~.
%
%Can cite multiple sources with \cite, as well as add a note.
%
%\cite is best used with a separate program called BibTex.
%
%BibTeX is used with \bibliography{} to produce the bibliography.
%
%Must also have a \bibliographystyle{} command.
%
%It is possible to split a LaTeX document into multiple files.  However, there is always
%a "master" file--the one specified on the command line.
%
%\input.  \input's may be nested--an \input'ted file may contain other file(s).
%
%Also an \include, which seems less useful.
%
%Making an index is covered in Section 4.5.1.
%
%Putting the \index{} command next to the indexed item with no spaces.  That style,
%with % character, on p. 75, is the one recommended.
%
%There is also \glossary capability.
%
%\index and \glossary are fragile.  However, they may contain special characters, like $.
%This is covered on p. 75.
%
%\typeout leaves messages on the terminal.
%
%\typein solicits input.  (Not useful for my application.)
%
%There is a section about sending files by e-mail.
%
%Other document classes:
%   Slides:  Not the best job for LaTeX.
%   letter document class.
