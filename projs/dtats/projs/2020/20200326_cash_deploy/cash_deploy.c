//Note:  Did not find a good solution to the problems of:
//       a)Buying a consistent number of shares at both endpoints.
//       b)Finding the next buy point without iterating through the price, penny by penny.
//       I'm sure an algebraic/mathematical solution exists for both problems, but I didn't have
//       enough time to invest (as of this writing).
