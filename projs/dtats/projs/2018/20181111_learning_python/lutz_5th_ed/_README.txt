#This directory contains notes and experiments as I worked through Mark Lutz's book, "Learning
#Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming 5th Edition, Kindle Edition".
#
#As of this writing (November, 2018), the book is listed on Amazon at this URL:
#   https://www.amazon.com/
#   Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Oriented-Programming-ebook-dp-B00DDZPC9S/dp/B00DDZPC9S/
#
#The files are broken down approximately by chapter.
#
#The materials should not in any way compromise the interests of the publisher.  These are my own
#notes, experiments, and examples as I learned Python, and I don't believe they can be used in
#any way as a substitute for the book or would decrease sales of the book (if anything, they would
#increase sales of the book).
