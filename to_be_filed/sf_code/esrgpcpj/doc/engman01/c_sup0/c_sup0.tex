        {Obtaining Support And Collaborating Electronically}
\label{csup0}

This chapter outlines support options; specifically:

\begin{itemize}
\item How to obtain support if \emph{The \tsname{}} does not
      behave as expected.
\item How to obtain support if there is difficulty building the
      tool set from source code.
\item How to obtain support in collaboration (in contributing to 
      the book, or in extending the tool set).
\item How to report tool bugs or errors/omissions in documentation.
\end{itemize}

\caption{Support And Collaboration Mailing Lists Maintained By The ESRG}
\label{tbl:csup0:smls0:01}
\end{table}

To join one of the mailing lists listed in 
Table \ref{tbl:csup0:smls0:01}, it is only necessary to 
send an e-mail to the \index{mailing lists!subscribing}
list manager \index{ezmlm-idx@\texttt{ezmlm-idx}}(\texttt{ezmlm-idx}).
The request to subscribe must be sent to the e-mail address \\
\longthingindent\texttt{list-}\emph{basename}\texttt{-subscribe@esrg.org},   \\
where \emph{basename} is the base name supplied in 
Table \ref{tbl:csup0:smls0:01}.  For example, to join the
\texttt{esrgtsusr} mailing list, an e-mail must be sent to \\
\longthingindent \texttt{list-esrgtsusr-subscribe@esrg.org}. \\
The 
\texttt{ezmlm-idx} list manager will
respond with a confirmation e-mail which must be replied to, and then
the subscription will be complete.  After subscription, the subscribed
e-mail address will receive all postings to the list.

\index{mailing lists!posting}To post to a 
list (after subscription), send an e-mail to \\
\longthingindent\texttt{list-}\emph{basename}\texttt{@esrg.org}, \\
where 
\emph{basename} is the base name supplied in 
Table \ref{tbl:csup0:smls0:01}.  For example, to post to the
\texttt{esrgtsusr} mailing list, an e-mail must be sent to \\
\longthingindent\texttt{list-esrgtsusr@esrg.org}.  \\
All lists allow attachments.

\index{mailing lists!unsubscribing}To unsubscribe 
from a list, send an e-mail to \\ 
\longthingindent\texttt{list-}\emph{basename}\texttt{-unsubscribe@esrg.org}, \\
where 
\emph{basename} is the base name supplied in 
Table \ref{tbl:csup0:smls0:01}.  For example, to unsubscribe from the
\texttt{esrgtsusr} mailing list, an e-mail must be sent to \\
\longthingindent\texttt{list-esrgtsusr-unsubscribe@esrg.org}.

The \texttt{ezmlm-idx} list manager will also allow past messages
to be automatically retrieved, and has other useful features.  
To automatically obtain a list of
all commands that can be issued to the 
\texttt{ezmlm-idx} list manager, an e-mail can be sent to \\
\longthingindent\texttt{list-}\emph{basename}\texttt{-help@esrg.org}, \\
where 
\emph{basename} is the base name supplied in 
Table \ref{tbl:csup0:smls0:01}.
For example, to obtain help for the
\texttt{esrgtsusr} mailing list, an e-mail can be sent to \\
\longthingindent\texttt{list-esrgtsusr-help@esrg.org}. \\
The \texttt{ezmlm-idx} list manager will reply with
a help message.

\section{Contacting Individuals Within The ESRG}
\label{csup0:scin0}

Directly contacting individuals within the ESRG is not recommended.
There are several reasons for this:

\begin{itemize}
\item A post to one of the mailing lists is more likely to put the 
      problem or question in the hands of the person who is best able
      to answer it.
\item E-mails sent to individuals are not automatically archived.
\item Answers to e-mails sent to individuals do not receive the
      benefits of peer review.
\item E-mail sent to individuals may result in an inordinate
      support load on some individuals.
\end{itemize}

For this reason, please do not send e-mails with questions 
or requests for support directly
to individuals within the ESRG.
