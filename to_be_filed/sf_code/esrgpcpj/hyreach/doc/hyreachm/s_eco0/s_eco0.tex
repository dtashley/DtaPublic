\section[Warning And Error Codes]{Warning Codes And Error Codes Produced By \swname{}}
\label{seco0}

\index{warning codes}\index{error codes}This section explains
all of the warning codes and error codes that can be
generated by \swname{}.  Each warning code or error code
produced by \swname{} consists of 5 characters, accompanied by a a text
message.  Warning codes begin with the `\emph{W}' character, and 
error codes begin with the `\emph{E}' character.

\begin{glossaryenum}
\item \index{WIFLI@\texttt{WIFLI}}\textbf{\texttt{WIFLI}} \\
      (Mnemonic:  \emph{i}ll-\emph{f}ormatted \emph{li}ne.)   The end
      of a line was marked with something other than the expected 13-10 2-byte 
      sequence.  The most likely cause for this warning is that a
      file was transferred in binary mode from a Unix system (Unix 
      traditionally uses only a single byte with the value of 10 to
      mark the end of line).

\item \index{EUTSL@\texttt{EUTSL}}\textbf{\texttt{EUTSL}} \\
      (Mnemonic:  \emph{u}n\emph{t}erminated \emph{s}tring \emph{l}iteral.)
      End of line or end of file was reached while a string literal was
      being processed (i.e. there was an opening quote (`\texttt{"}') but
      no corresponding closing quote before the line or file ended).
