CONTENTS
   This subdirectory contains a rational approximation paper and
   supporting demonstration software that was submitted to the
   journal "ACM Transactions On Mathematical Software" around
   October of 2000.  The authors were David T. Ashley, Joseph P.
   DeVoe, Karl Perttunen, Cory Pratt, and Anatoly Zhigljavsky.

   After spending one year in review, the reviews were second-rate
   One of the two reviews was reasonable, but it was clear in the
   second review that the reviewer did not understand the paper.
   One [silly] comment was to ask why the system proposed was better
   than mediant rounding.  That was a purely idiotic comment, because
   mediant rounding is a system of representation, but the topic
   of the paper was simply how to choose a rational number.

   After much human drama, because of the long review delay, it
   was decided to instead publish a shorter version in "Embedded
   Systems Programming" magazine.

   There are two subdirectories, "paper" (for the paper) and
   "c_imp" (for the demonstration software).

   Please see the "_license.txt" file for licensing information.

MNEMONIC
