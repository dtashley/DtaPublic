Materials Using Anonymous CVS Access</font></b></p>
<hr>
<p><a href="../../glossary/glossary.htm#cvs_vc" target="_blank">CVS</a> is the
version control system most in favor with the open-source community.&nbsp; Using
CVS, one can collaborate with other software developers in the development of
source files and other documents.&nbsp; <a href="http://sourceforge.net" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>
has cryptographic security in place for those wishing to collaborate in
development (i.e. to change or add files using CVS), and getting set up to collaborate
in this way is
a complicated process.&nbsp; However, if you only wish to obtain the newest
revisions or specific revisions of files (but do not wish to modify the CVS
repository), the process is much simpler, and is described on this page.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Be sure that you wish to obtain the materials via CVS.</b>&nbsp;
    Obtaining the materials via CVS has the disadvantage that the files you
    obtain may not correspond to any released version of <i>The ESRG Tool Set</i>.&nbsp;
    The differences between anonymous CVS access and using one of the source
    distributions are described <a href="../esrg_src_howtos/anon_cvs_vs_targz.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;
    If you wish to obtain material via anonymous CVS, it should be for one of
    the following reasons:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>You require materials more recent than the latest source distribution. </li>
    <li>You wish to obtain materials that are not packaged in any distribution
      (the <a href="../../glossary/glossary.htm#installshield_express" target="_blank">InstallShield
      Express</a> project file, for example). </li>
    </ul>
  <li><b>Obtain a list of all CVS modules.</b>&nbsp; &quot;module&quot; is a CVS
    term for a top-level directory in the CVS repository.&nbsp; The easiest way
    to obtain a list of all CVS modules is to view <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/esrg/" target="_blank">this
    web page</a> and print it or write down all the folder names (except <i>CVSROOT</i>,
    which can be ignored).&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Obtain a CVS client.</b>&nbsp; For a Windows® system, the CVS
    executable and brief instructions are <a href="../../arch_sw_etc/cvs_1_11/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;
    If you type &quot;<i>cvs</i>&quot; at a DOS command prompt and receive a
    message from the CVS program, you have installed the client
    successfully.&nbsp; The following screen snapshot shows a typical message
    from a CVS client when only &quot;<i>cvs</i>&quot; is typed.
    <p align="center"><img border="0" src="cvs_msg_no_cmd.gif" width="612" height="251"></p>
  </li>
  <li><b>Open a [DOS] shell.</b>&nbsp; On Windows® systems, this is normally
    done from the <i>Start</i> menu, <i>Start</i> <font face="Wingdings 3">g</font>
    <i>Programs</i> <font face="Wingdings 3">g</font> <i>Accessories</i> <font face="Wingdings 3">g</font>
    <i>Command Prompt</i>.&nbsp; On *nix systems, the procedure to obtain a
    shell varies.</li>
  <li><b>Change directories to &quot;c:\&quot; (Window® systems only).</b>&nbsp;
    On Windows® systems, the checkout must be performed from the root directory
    of the C: drive.&nbsp; On *nix systems, any directory will do.</li>
  <li><b>Issue the CVS checkout commands, specifying the modules gathered
    earlier.</b>&nbsp; For example, as of April 2003, the following command
    would be appropriate (the list of modules may have changed or grown since
    then):<br>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier" size="2">cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/esrg
    checkout esrgdocs esrgdstb esrgnxpj esrgpcpj esrgpubs esrgubka esrgweba<br>
    </font><br>
    Also as of April, 2003, the total number quantity of data to be downloaded
    is about 40 Mb (at least 4 hours over a typical modem connection).<br>
    <br>
    A CVS checkout has the advantage that if the checkout is interrupted (by a
    dropped modem connection, for example), issuing the same command again will
    effectively resume where the previous attempt left off.&nbsp; CVS recognizes
    files which have already been checked out and skips them on subsequent
    checkout attempts.<br>
    <br>
    It is also possible that you require only a subset of the modules listed
    above.&nbsp; If this is the case, only list those modules you need on the
    CVS command line.</li>
