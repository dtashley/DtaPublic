Practitioner's Guide ...</i>&quot;) Description</font></b></p>
<hr>
<p>The ESRG book under construction, tentatively entitled &quot;<i>A
Practitioner's Guide To The Design And Development Of Small Microcontroller
Software</i>&quot;, is a unique undertaking on the Internet.&nbsp; The unique
features are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The book contains many insights and many mathematical results that are (to
    the best of our knowledge) not available anywhere else.</li>
  <li>The book is not constrained for length, since at this time it is published
    only electronically on the Internet.&nbsp; This means that there is room for
    unlimited
    numbers of examples, peripheral observations, conjectures, unsolved problems,
    etc.</li>
  <li>The book is collaborative (anyone can pitch in).</li>
  <li>The book is open-source (however, licensing issues are still being worked out), so
    that all <a href="../glossary/glossary.htm#latex" target="_blank">LaTeX</a>
    source code and other files are under version control and available in their
    entirety via anonymous <a href="../glossary/glossary.htm#cvs_vc" target="_blank">CVS</a>.&nbsp;
    This means, for example, that anyone can use this book as an example of how
    to lay out the LaTeX source files of another book.</li>
</ul>
<p>The title of the book accurately describes its content.&nbsp; It is about
small microcontroller software.</p>
