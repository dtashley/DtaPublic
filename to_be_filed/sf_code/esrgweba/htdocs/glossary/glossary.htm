<p style="margin-bottom: -16"><b><u><a name="nix_system"></a>*nix System</u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A <i>*nix system</i> is a computer system based on an operating system
  similar to Unix.&nbsp; In practice, most software that can be compiled for any
  *nix system can be compiled for all *nix systems.&nbsp; Modern *nix systems
  include Sun Solaris, <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, and Linux.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: -16"><b><u><a name="cvs_vc"></a>CVS</u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.cvshome.org">CVS</a> is the version control system most favored by the open-source
  community.&nbsp; It has many advantages for collaboration, including its
  default non-locking checkout model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: -16"><b><u><a name="installshield_express"></a>InstallShield Express</u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>InstallShield Express</i> is a product of <a href="http://www.installshield.com">InstallShield</a>,
  and allows one to quickly and intuitively build installations for the
  Windows® family of operating systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: -16"><b><u><a name="latex"></a>LaTeX</u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>LaTeX</i> is the single most user-hostile text processing program on the
  planet, but also perhaps the best at typesetting mathematics.&nbsp; It
  requires that one prepare a text file (or more likely, a large set of text
  files) to be processed in multiple passes of a LaTeX compiler and related
  utilities (utilities to collect index entries, for example).&nbsp; One might
  best describe LaTeX as a typesetting compiler.&nbsp; The ESRG book &quot;<i>A
  Practitioner's Guide ...</i>&quot; is prepared using LaTeX because of the
  heavy mathematical content.</p>
  <p>LaTeX started with TeX and Donald Knuth's work on mathematical
  typesetting.&nbsp; This is an excerpt from <a href="http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/feb98/0307.html" target="_blank">a
  web page</a> giving a partial history of LaTeX:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font size="2">[1974]<br>
    Knuth stops submitting papers to the AMS because &quot;the finished<br>
    product was just too painful for me to look at&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">[1977]<br>
    Knuth begins his research on typography.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">[1978]<br>
    Knuth delivers an AMS Gibbs Lecture entitled Mathematical<br>
    Typography [Bull. AMS, vol. 1 (March 1979), no. 2, pp. 337--372] to<br>
    the AMS membership at its annual meeting.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2">[1979]<br>
    Digital Equipment Corporation and the American Mathematical Society<br>
    jointly publish Knuth's book TeX and METAFONT: New Directions in<br>
    Typesetting, which contains the text of Knuth's Gibbs Lecture.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>There are many distributions of LaTeX, all of which should and nearly
  always do perform identically.&nbsp; The most popular free distribution on the
  Internet is probably <a href="http://www.miktex.org/" target="_blank">MikTeX</a>.&nbsp;
  A very popular CD distribution with a very useful GUI is <a href="http://4tex.ntg.nl/" target="_blank">4allTeX</a>.&nbsp;
  If you want to get started right away and have a broadband connection, <a href="http://www.mikex.org" target="_blank">MikTeX</a>
  is probably the way to go.</p>
  <p>LaTeX runs on *nix systems as well as Windows® systems--in fact, some
  might argue that it runs better on *nix systems.&nbsp; A great many web pages
  on the Internet--especially technical web pages--are compiled using software
  that will generate documents and web pages from the same LaTeX source
  code.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: -16"><b><u><a name="tar_gz_file"></a><i>tar.gz</i> File</u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A <i>.tar.gz</i> file is a compressed archive of files created on a *nix
  system, very similar in function to a <i>.zip</i> file (in fact, WinZip will
  process <i>.tar.gz</i> files, thus allowing one to open *nix archives on a
  Windows® system).&nbsp; <i>.tar.gz</i> files are traditionally created by the
  *nix <i>tar</i> utility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-bottom: -16"><b><u><a name="tcl_tk"></a>Tcl/Tk</u></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><i>Tcl</i>, short for <i><u>t</u>ool <u>c</u>ommand <u>l</u>anguage</i>, is
  an open-source scripting language originally developed by Scriptics, which
  became Ajuba Solutions and was thereafter purchased by <a href="http://www.interwoven.com" target="_blank">Interwoven</a>.</p>
  <p><i>Tk</i> is a set of graphical extensions to Tcl (so that it can display
  windows, buttons, etc.).</p>
  <p>The ESRG scripting tools are based on Tcl and Tk.</p>
