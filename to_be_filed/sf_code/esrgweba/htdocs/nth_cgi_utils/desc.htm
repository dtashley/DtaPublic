<p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberTheory.html">Number theory</a> is
the study of whole numbers and their properties.&nbsp; (<i>Number theory</i> is
sometimes also described as the study of integers and integer fields, an
equivalent definition.)&nbsp; Notions such as <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html">prime</a>
and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompositeNumber.html">composite</a>
numbers, as well as famous problems such as <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatsLastTheorem.html">Fermat's
last theorem</a>, come from number theory.&nbsp; Many famous mathematicians,
such as <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Gauss.html">Gauss</a>
and <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Euler.html">Euler</a>,
were number theorists or made substantial contributions to number theory.</p>
<p>Number theory is pivotally important in the digital age, as the difficulty of
factoring a composite which is the product of large primes is the basis for <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RSAEncryption.html">RSA
public-key cryptography</a>.&nbsp; Number theory also sometimes becomes a
consideration in embedded control work, as microcontrollers deal most
efficiently with integers and ultimately every input and output of a
microcontroller is an integer.&nbsp; Number theory sometimes enters into
microcontroller arithmetic (rational approximation, for example) or into
hardware design (ratiometric conversion in software, for example).</p>
<p>All of the CGI-BIN number theory utilities found at this site perform a
calculation or a service which has as its basis number theory.</p>
<p>Number theory utilities generally require software to work with large
integers.&nbsp; All of the CGI-BIN number theory utilities at this site make use
of the <a href="http://www.swox.com/gmp">GMP library</a>, a library for dealing
with arbitrarily large integers and arbitrary-precision numbers.&nbsp; Computer
arithmetic with large integers is not a trivial matter, and much research has
been done about how to efficiently multiply, divide, and perform other
operations on large integers (for example, <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/KaratsubaMultiplication.html">Karatsuba
multiplication</a>).&nbsp; Using the GMP library for a CGI-BIN application also
requires some technical savvy, and the details are <a href="../howtos/sourceforge/use_the_gmp.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, all source code for the number theory utilities I've placed on
the web is available <a href="../howtos/nth_web_gmp_src_code_dist/obtain_all_source.htm">here</a>.</p>
