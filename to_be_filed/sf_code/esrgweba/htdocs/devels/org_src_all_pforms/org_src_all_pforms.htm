*nix And Windows® Computers</font></b></p>
<hr>
<p>All product source code and other materials (if one wishes to rebuild
products) <b>must have a canonical location and arrangement on the computer used
to build the products</b>.&nbsp; This arrangement is described here.</p>
<ul>
  <li>On a *nix machine, where relative paths are the norm, all of the ESRG
    materials may placed <i>anywhere</i> in the directory structure of the *nix
    machine so long as they preserve the same directory hierarchy as the <a href="../../glossary/glossary.htm#cvs_vc" target="_blank"> CVS</a>
    archives.&nbsp; This is generally achieved by checking out all CVS modules
    from the same location (and usually at the same time).&nbsp; For example,
    the following command:<br>
    <br>
    <font face="Courier" size="2">cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/esrg checkout esrgdocs esrgdstb esrgnxpj esrgpcpj esrgphpa esrgpubs esrgubka esrgweba</font><br>
    <br>
    could be executed in any directory on a *nix system and would arrange all
    the CVS modules correctly.&nbsp; (<i>Note:</i>&nbsp; the above command
    assumes anonymous CVS access and also assumes the list of CVS modules that
    are in existence as of April, 2003--the actual list may differ slightly by
    the time you read this web page.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>On a Windows® machine, <b>the absolute path to each file must be exactly
    the same on every machine used for development</b> (this is a more stringent
    requirement than for *nix machines).&nbsp; The reason for the more stringent
    requirement is that some Windows applications (such as <a href="../../glossary/glossary.htm#installshield_express" target="_blank">InstallShield
    Express</a>) are not designed to handle relative paths.<br>
    <br>
    What this means in practice is that on a Windows® machine, all CVS
    checkouts must be done while the current working directory is
    &quot;C:\&quot; (for example, the example CVS command given above must be
    executed from &quot;C:\&quot;).&nbsp; This ensures that each module occupies a directory
    directly under &quot;C:\&quot;.&nbsp; (By the way, all of the ESRG CVS
    modules were named starting with &quot;esrg&quot; so that their origin would
    be clear and so that they would not collide with any existing directories on
    a Windows® machine.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The requirements above can be phrased in an alternate and more compact way:</p>
<ul>
  <li>On both *nix and Windows® machines, all ESRG CVS modules must have the
    same relative relationship (they must be siblings in a root directory), and</li>
  <li>On a *nix machine, this root directory is arbitrary, but on a Windows®
    machine, this root directory must be &quot;C:\&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Particularly on Windows® machines, <i>absolute</i> paths are assumed.&nbsp;
For example, the file <i>c:\esrgubka\svf.pdf</i> <b>must</b> exist when building
the <i>InstallShield Express</i> distribution.</p>
