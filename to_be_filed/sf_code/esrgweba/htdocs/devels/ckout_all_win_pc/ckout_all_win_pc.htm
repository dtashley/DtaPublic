<hr>
<p>To maintain good administrative order, there is a policy for how version
numbers of materials released by the ESRG are assigned, and how the materials
are released.&nbsp; Here are the policies.</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>All materials and downloads are released simultaneously with the same
    version number.</b>&nbsp; (This means that every release is a
    &quot;full&quot; release.&nbsp; It is possible or even likely that some
    materials are unchanged from release to release except for the version
    number.)<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>There are NO patches.</b>&nbsp; If a bug is not critical, it can be
    ignored until the next release.&nbsp; If a bug is critical, it can
    accelerate the next release (perhaps the release would be made with just the
    bug fix).&nbsp; Releases are &quot;all or nothing&quot;, and there is no
    notion of a &quot;patch&quot;.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>There are NO &quot;silent&quot; releases.</b>&nbsp; To avoid confusion,
    any change in the set of released materials requires another version number.&nbsp; Allowing a
    situation where two things which are [even subtly] different but have the
    same version number causes confusion.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Version numbers are of the form:</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>&lt;Major number&gt;.&lt;2-Digit Minor number&gt;&lt;Optional
    &quot;A&quot; for &quot;alpha&quot; release&gt;.&lt;2-digit bug fix
    number&gt;</b><br>
    <br>
    For example, these are valid version numbers and their meanings:<br>
    <ul>
    <li><b>1.06A.00</b>:&nbsp; This is the &quot;alpha&quot; (trial, or not
      fully stable) release of version 1.06.&nbsp; (Note that &quot;A&quot; is
      normally only used with a bug fix number of &quot;00&quot;.)&nbsp;</li>
    <li><b>1.07.09</b>:&nbsp; This is the ninth bug fix release of stable
      release version 1.07.00.<br>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <li><b>Version numbers normally follow this sequential cycle:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>An alpha release, such as &quot;v1.06A.00&quot;.</li>
    <li>A stable release, which will consist of the alpha release with any bugs
      corrected, such as &quot;v1.06.00&quot;.</li>
    <li>Bug fixes to the stable release, such as &quot;v1.06.01&quot;,
      &quot;v1.06.02&quot;, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
