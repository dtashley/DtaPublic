<p><b><u><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</u></b></p>

<p>The interview and hiring process is flawed, especially when it
comes to evaluating and hiring top performers.&nbsp; I do not participate in the process without some restrictions.&nbsp;
Most of the restrictions come about in reaction to specific abuses I've encountered by
employers.</p>

<hr>
<p><b><u><a name="marry_supermodel"></a>What It Takes To Marry A Supermodel</u></b></p>

<p>There is no employer in existence that can keep up with me.&nbsp; I've made
original contributions to number theory and real-time analysis; and I have <i> mastered</i> small embedded software development.&nbsp; I've made a career out
of innovation and out of solving difficult problems that have plagued embedded
control work for decades.&nbsp; I've turned down
interviews with <a href="http://www.ibm.com" target="_blank">IBM</a>, <a href="http://www.hp.com" target="_blank">Hewlett-Packard</a>,
<a href="http://www.cisco.com" target="_blank">Cisco</a>, and others; for the
simple reason that they failed to impress me during an initial phone contact.&nbsp; It is
the same game in any organization--defective supervisors and managers
who make administrative and technical messes and then saddle engineers with
their own negligence; all the while not learning from mistakes and not taking
responsibility for their actions.&nbsp; I've not yet encountered an organization that
develops embedded software that can even meet the most basic of
goals--administrative neatness.&nbsp; All prospective employers are guilty until
proven innocent.</p>

<p>The typical interview is a mixture of two elements:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Tedious technical questions from interviewers who are not technically
    mature enough to parse a competent reply.</li>
  <li>Questions designed to gauge how well I would adapt to mediocrity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Life is too short for <i>either</i> element, but (2) is particularly
annoying.&nbsp; (2) usually comes from supervisors and managers, and it is the
same old old set of <i>give us more time</i> attempted deceptions.&nbsp; My
message to the individuals who are posing questions in category (2) above is
simple:&nbsp; <i>Why don't you spend 1-2 extra hours per day trying to <b>change</b>
the situations you warn interview candidates about?</i>&nbsp; My personal
interview process is designed to weed out those employers who are not truly
interested in performing or competing.</p>

<p>I define the following numerical ranking of employers:</p>

<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="0" width="60%">
    <tr>
      <td width="21%" align="center"><b>+1 (Positive)</b></td>
      <td width="7%"> </td>
      <td width="151%"> An employer who can teach me new skills or give me new insight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="21%" align="center"><b>0 (Neutral)</b></td>
      <td width="7%"> </td>
      <td width="151%"> An employer that&nbsp;cannot teach me new skills or give
        me new insight, but will not interfere with my productivity or my
        ability to contribute to the organization.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="21%" align="center"><b>-1 (Negative)</b></td>
      <td width="7%"></td>
      <td width="151%">An employer that will interfere with my productivity or my
        ability to contribute to the organization.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  </center>
</div>
<p>No existing organization is <b>+1</b> on the scale above.&nbsp; I make
this statement because I'm truly visionary and no employer to date has been able
to keep up.</p>
<p>It is not appropriate for me to think about an employer in terms of
self-actualization or what I might learn on the job, <i>because no employer has
anything to teach me</i>.&nbsp; The most I can hope for from an employer is an
environment where my performance is not diluted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rate work environments nearly exclusively on how profoundly the employer
will limit my productivity and my ability to make a competitive contribution to
the organization.&nbsp; <b>The way to marry a supermodel (me) is to convince me
that you can provide an environment free of performance obstacles.</b></p>

<p><b><u><a name="req_interviews"></a>My Requirements For Interviews And The
Hire Process</u></b></p>

<p>I've found through experience that employers are capable of a lot of unproductive
behavior at interviews.</p>

<p>The most common difficulty I encounter at interviews is that <i>the
interviewer is not technically mature enough to interview me or to understand my
responses to questions</i>.&nbsp; Typically, interviewers will pose questions
reflecting a lack of insight into the nature of problems or will pose reasonable
questions but not be technically mature enough to understand my responses.&nbsp;
I've not yet found a completely effective way to avoid the effects of a gap in
technical maturity which is too large.</p>

<p>My interview requirements, which come directly from unproductive behaviors by employers, are enumerated below.</p>

<div align="center">
  <center>
  <table border="2" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b><u>Requirement</u></b></td>
      <td width="50%"><b><u>Potential Undesirable Behavior</u></b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b>All items representing significant interview expense (airfare, rental
        car, hotels, copies of books or papers, etc.) must be purchased in advance by the prospective
        employer or I must be reimbursed in advance.</b></td>
      <td width="50%">I've encountered employers where it was difficult to
        obtain reimbursement.&nbsp; I choose not to take the risk that sooner or
        later, I will encounter an employer where it is <i>impossible</i> to
        obtain reimbursement.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b>A hiring decision must be made based on only one day of
        interviews (there will be no second round of interviews).</b></td>
      <td width="50%">I've had employers ask me in for interviews when they had
        already decided to hire another candidate but &quot;<i>just wanted to be sure</i>&quot;
        (this is like asking another girl out on the day before your
        wedding).&nbsp; I've also quite often had employers fail to disclose in
        advance the number of interviews required, leading to a situation where
        I keep receiving phone calls with the message of &quot;<i>... there is one
        more person who'd like to meet you before we make a decision</i>&quot;.&nbsp;
        Restricting the interview process to one event prevents abuse by the
        employer.&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b>Interviews in total may not span more than 4 hours.</b></td>
      <td width="50%">I've been through interviews that lasted the entire
        day.&nbsp; Typically, each interviewer had a 1-hour slot, and would ask pretty much the same questions as every other interviewer.&nbsp;
        This is unproductive.&nbsp; In general, the maximum number of
        individuals that reasonably have a need to meet me are:
        <ul>
          <li>A representative from HR.</li>
          <li>My potential colleagues.</li>
          <li>My potential boss.</li>
          <li>My potential boss' boss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That can all be squeezed into 4 hours or less.&nbsp; The easiest way
        to do this is to combine the interviews of all potential colleagues or
        combine the interviews in other ways.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b>Interviews must not include lunch.</b></td>
      <td width="50%">I do not believe that a lunch with a candidate has any
        value in evaluating the candidate's fit with a particular job or a
        particular company.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="50%"><b>Reference checks must be made <i>after</i> a decision
        to hire.</b></td>
      <td width="50%">I've had problems in the past with recruiters and
        prospective employers wasting a lot of my references' time by checking
        references too early in the hire process.&nbsp; Some reference checks
        have been quite invasive (20+ minutes of questions).
        <p>For this reason I require that reference checks be the absolute <i>last</i>
        step in the process.
        <p>I would also add that reference checks have a limited value in
        evaluating top performers such as me.&nbsp; Some employers in the past
        have placed undue emphasis on the opinions of previous
        supervisors.&nbsp; Since all supervisors I've encountered in the past
        are substandard performers, the opinions they would give are
        predictable.&nbsp; One could expect statements like &quot;<i>He couldn't
        accept mediocrity</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>He was uncontrollable</i>&quot;.&nbsp;
        The true meaning of those statements is &quot;<i>He was not satisfied
        with my performance, and in some cases discussed it with me frankly and
        asked me to work a bit harder</i>&quot;.&nbsp; The opinions of past
        supervisors are meaningless.</td>

        server which I administer, and this is also the mechanism I use to share
        information with bosses and colleagues.&nbsp; The server normally
        includes a search engine.&nbsp; Usually, permission involves only a
        short conversation or e-mail exchange with the company's IT
        manager.&nbsp; I don't work in environments where I am not allowed to
