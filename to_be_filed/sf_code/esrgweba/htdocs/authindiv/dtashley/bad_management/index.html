<p><b><u><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</u></b></p>

<p>I (Dave Ashley) have become really cautious about which recruiters I deal
with, which employment interviews I consent to, and which job offers I accept.&nbsp;
Understandably, my caution comes from experience.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the management in the auto industry involved with the
development of small embedded systems is the <i>worst</i>
management I've seen anywhere.&nbsp; The general components of the poor
management performance and low-quality work environments are discussed at some length in
the following sections.</p>

<p>Some might claim I have a <i>bad attitude</i>.&nbsp; Nothing could be further
from the truth.&nbsp; In most cases the key issue is an elusive quality that
I'll call <i>technical maturity</i>.&nbsp; Some people (specifically, the bad
supervisors and managers I've had the dishonor of working with) go their entire careers and never grasp
the essential nature of the technical and management problems they confront on a
daily basis.&nbsp; That <i>failure to technically mature</i> does not make these
individuals <i>morally</i>  defective--it just makes them <i> technically</i>
defective.&nbsp; My desire to distance myself from such individuals doesn't come
from anti-social tendencies; but rather from the self-preservation
instinct.</p>

<p>I'm very much reminded of a quote from one of the Superman movies where Lex
Luthor (Gene Hackman) <font size="6">(</font><img border="0" src="lex_luthor.jpg" align="absmiddle" hspace="5" vspace="5" width="53" height="73"><font size="6">)</font>
delivers a line something like, &quot;<i>Otis, why is it that some people can
read the list of ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of
the universe while others can read `War and Peace' and come away thinking it is
a simple adventure novel?</i>&quot;.&nbsp; How true, Lex, how true!&nbsp; Some
people don't get it and won't <i> ever</i> get it.</p>

<p>Much of the remainder of this page is devoted to observations about
management that has failed to technically mature.</p>

<hr>
<p><b><u><a name="what_achieve"></a>What Is One Trying To Achieve In Software
Development?</u></b></p>
<p>Before slamming bad management for failing to <i>get it</i>, one should state
what it is that needs to be gotten.&nbsp; What is one trying to achieve in
software development?</p>

<p>On the administrative side, the bare minimum that one is trying to achieve is
<i><b>administrative neatness</b></i>.&nbsp; In modern software development, neatness
is <i>not</i> neatly-labeled file folders and <i>Microsoft Word</i>®
documents with attractive cover pages and attractive headers and
footers.&nbsp; <i>Neatness</i> is a <b> comprehensive information management plan</b>
that:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Minimizes reliance on paper.</b>&nbsp; Treeware <i>is</i> necessary
    sometimes.&nbsp; Personally, I've found that when I'm reviewing something
    complex I <i>must</i> have it on paper.&nbsp; However, web-based databases
    and paperless technologies are now the norm.</li>
  <li><b>Addresses the needs and usage scenarios of everyone who participates in
    the software development.</b>&nbsp; Everyone who participates in software
    development or testing needs electronic resources to store their work
    products.</li>
  <li><b>Minimizes redundancy of information.</b>&nbsp; Although it is
    impossible to eliminate information redundancy entirely, one must make a
    best attempt.&nbsp; The <i>first</i> level of attempt is to have a <i>policy</i>
    for where all product development information is stored: this prevents
    unnecessary redundancy because all employees know where each type of
    information should be stored.&nbsp; The <i>second</i> level of attempt is to
    complement any policy weaknesses with tools that maintain information
    consistency automatically.&nbsp; Unfortunately, most software development
    organizations do not even make it to the first level of attempt.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the human resources side, the bare minimum one is trying to achieve
is to <i><b>create the most rewarding experience for the top 10% of technical
contributors</b></i>.&nbsp; Not all engineers or employees contribute
equally.&nbsp; The 10% of engineers/employees that contribute the most
technically to product development tend to have unstable personalities (these
are the people you want to keep away from customers, for example).&nbsp; These
individuals tend to strive for technical excellence, and don't tolerate
environments that dilute their productivity.&nbsp; So, it makes sense for an
employer to try to create an environment free of performance obstacles so as to
be able to retain these individuals.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming that an employer needs to <i>identify</i> the top 10% of
technical contributors in order to be effective at retaining these
people.&nbsp;&nbsp;All that is necessary is to create an environment where those
who wish to perform can do so.</p>
<p>It may be difficult to for the reader to envision a scenario that creates a
low-quality experience for a solid technical contributor.&nbsp; A concrete
example is that &quot;coding standards&quot; example, which I present next in
the section <a href="#perfdil_immat_man" target="_self">Performance Dilution By Technically
Immature Management</a>.</p>

<p><b><u><a name="perfdil_immat_man"></a>Performance Dilution By Technically
Immature Management</u></b></p>
<p>One phenomenon that drives away gifted engineers is <i>performance dilution
by technically immature management</i>.&nbsp; The nature of the phenomenon is
that management often doesn't understand the work or the nature of the work well
enough to make sound decisions; and some of the decisions (or failures to make
decisions) invariably lower the quality of life for engineers.&nbsp; The most
gifted engineers tend to have the strongest desire to contribute to the
company's productivity, and so these decisions tend to frustrate the most gifted
engineers into leaving the company.&nbsp; The net effect is to place an upper
limit on the caliber of employees the company can retain.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of differentially frustrating employees is also mentioned by
Colin Powell in his awesome presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i> (available <a href="powellonleadership.zip">here</a>
as a .ZIP'd PowerPoint presentation).&nbsp; The bottom line is that the most
productive employees are most sensitive to obstacles to their
productivity.&nbsp; The graphic below is from Powell's presentation.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="powell_01.gif" width="720" height="540"></p>
<p>One example from my own career is the issue of <i>coding standards</i>.&nbsp;
At one point in my career with a large company, I was given responsibility for
products that were politely called <i>legacy products</i>.&nbsp; <i>Legacy
products</i> was a euphemism for products that had been poorly-designed and
modified too many times.</p>
<p>Each file that I opened in these legacy products contained inconsistent
indentation and a mixture of space and tab characters (something that is
prohibited by most coding standards).&nbsp; Because 'C' functions in embedded
work can be quite lengthy, the net result is that I had to&nbsp;replace all tabs
with spaces and then manually indent about 10,000 lines of code.&nbsp; It was an
unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>During the experience, I discussed with my boss the need for coding standards
that prohibit tab characters in source files.&nbsp; He was unenthusiastic about
coding standards in general, and nothing ever got done.&nbsp; The net result was
sure to be that more source files with inconsistent indentation were coming my
way.</p>
<p>The general trend with bad management is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Engineers will suggest process, technical, or administrative improvements
    to management.&nbsp; (Often, these suggestions come directly from situations
    in the work place that are lowering the quality of life for engineers.)</li>
  <li>The management will not be technically mature enough to understand the
    merit of the suggestions and/or will be insensitive to the way in which the
    current situation lowers the quality of work life for engineers.</li>
  <li>The suggestions will not be implemented at all, or in a best case some of
    the suggestions will be implemented (but always the suggestions--usually the
    least strategically important ones--that are consistent with the technical
    maturity of the management).</li>
  <li>The most gifted engineers (who are usually more sensitive to the
    frustration) leave the company.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p><b><u><a name="coevolution"></a>Co-Evolution</u></b></p>
<p>One question I often ask myself is &quot;<i>How did things get so bad in
small embedded work?</i>&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm convinced that the answer lies in evolution and co-evolution.&nbsp; From
time to time, one may watch a nature special where in some dark cave with a
closed ecosystem, a species of blind fish has evolved.&nbsp; Blind fish can
exist in such an environment because they do not need to see.</p>
<p>Similarly, I'm convinced that the poor management skills abundant in small
embedded work come from the environment.&nbsp; Every project is small enough
that one can just keep throwing people at it and somehow the work will get done,
even without a design.&nbsp; Skill <i>is not</i> necessary.&nbsp; A large pool
of young energetic engineers who are easily deceived and manipulated <i>is</i>
necessary.</p>
<p>In projects of higher complexity, the same approach would fail miserably.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b>&nbsp; Why are the supervisors and managers of small embedded
software products so bad?</p>
<p><b>A:</b>&nbsp; Because they <i>can</i> be (the complexity of the product
allows it).&nbsp;</p>
