\beginchapterquote{``I've watched lots of corporations come and go.  \ldots{} 
                     There are very few companies that have been around for 40 or 50 years.  \ldots{} 
                     Companies come and go.  It's part of the genius of capitalism.  
                     People get to make good decisions or bad decisions, and they 
                     get to pay the consequences or to enjoy the fruits of 
                     their decisions.  That's the way the system works.''}
