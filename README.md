# David T. Ashley's Public Projects, Including *The EMTS* (Embedded Tool Set)

This repository contains my public personal projects, as well as *The EMTS*
(Embedded Tool Set).

To minimize code redundancy, my personal projects build from some of the same
source code as *The EMTS*.  The practical implication is:

* If obtaining code to build one of my personal projects, it is
  recommended to obtain the *entire* repository.

* If obtaining code to build *The EMTS*, only the directory containing
  *The EMTS* is necessary.

Please feel free to contact me at *dashley@gmail.com* with any questions,
suggestions, or concerns.

Thanks and best regards,
Dave Ashley
