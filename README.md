David T. Ashley's Public Projects
---------------------------------
This repository contains all of my projects with public visibllity.
Currently, I'm using svn (on a home server) as my primary version
control system, with git as a mirror.  For this reason, some
elements of the repository structure are more characteristic of
svn (such as the presence of tags directories and svn keyword
expansions).
