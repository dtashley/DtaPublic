\section{Corrupted Software Build Output}

A recent article in \emph{Scientific American}
highlighted that data transfers and RAM contents in computers
were vulnerable to errors.  During the single build of
an embedded software load, how large is the probability
that the build output will be corrupted, and does this
probability justify any special build procedures, especially when
MROM is involved?
