\chapter{Preface}

In 1998, I began work on the
interrupt latency compatibility problem.  As I searched
for prior work, I was
surprised to discover the paucity
of research available on practical embedded software
problems.  Textbooks were also not very helpful,
as I found that almost none
of the hard
problems that occur in practice
were addressed.

In 1999, I decided to compose my own book,
maintained on the Web,
to collect useful
research results, solutions to practical problems,
unsolved problems, and directions for future
research and refinement.
\LaTeX{} was chosen as the text-processing
tool, as it was 
recognized immediately
that size could become an issue and that the book
would have a substantial mathematical content.
The freedom from any practical length
limitation
means that I am
free to include as many topics
in as much detail as I'd like.\footnote{My readers will
be consuming \emph{their} toner cartridges, not mine.}

In 2001, this book was moved to 
\index{SourceForge}\emph{SourceForge}\footnote{\emph{SourceForge}
(\texttt{http://www.sourceforge.net}), to whom I am very grateful,
is an organization that hosts open-source projects.} and
combined with a tool
set for microcontroller software work 
(\emph{The Iju Tool Set}).

In 2002, the collective set of materials (the tool set and this book) 
was renamed \emph{The ESRG Tool Set}\footnote{\emph{ESRG}
is an acronym for \emph{E}mbedded \emph{S}ystems \emph{R}esearch \emph{G}roup.}, 
and placed under a different
project at \emph{SourceForge}.

\emph{The ESRG Tool Set}, which is fully open-source and 
available for free from \emph{SourceForge} at the URL
\texttt{http://esrg.sourceforge.net}, contains 
these materials: 

\begin{itemize} 
\item A \texttt{.PDF} copy of the most recent released
      version of this book.

\item The packaged \LaTeX{} source code and graphics
      for the most recent released
      version of this book.

\item The most recent (unreleased) source code for this book
      (available from the CVS version control archives).

\item The most recent released version of 
      \emph{The ESRG Tool Set}, packaged as an installation
      for Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP.  This installation also
	  contains web pages with helpful URLs, and supplemental
	  materials (such as spreadsheets to demonstrate techniques,
	  other documents and standards maintained as part of this
	  effort,
	  Java applets, etc.).

\item The packaged source code for the most recent released
      version of \emph{The ESRG Tool Set}.

\item The most recent (unreleased) source code of
      \emph{The ESRG Tool Set} (available from the CVS
      version control arvhives).

\item The most recent (unreleased) versions of the non-tool
      materials maintained with \emph{The ESRG Tool Set}, including
	  spreadsheets to demonstrate techniques, other
      documents and standards maintained as part of this
	  effort, Java applets, etc. (available from the CVS version control
	  archives).
\end{itemize} 


I have produced this set of works with the following four goals.
\marginpar{\textbf{Goals of This Work}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{To share results and coordinate work
   with researchers.}  I have
   found that there is a disconnect between practitioners
   (those who have exposure to difficult problems) and
   researchers (those who often have the ability to solve these
   difficult problems).  A large work is required to
   explain the design challenges present in practical embedded software
   work, and to place the most difficult unsolved problems in the hands
   of researchers.
\item \textbf{To share results and coordinate work with practitioners.}
   Many of the problems and solutions presented in this work apply
   to almost all applications of embedded software, and in many cases
   are inherent to \emph{all} software.  These problems and solutions
   will be useful to software practitioners.  I also expect
   that practitioners have strong solutions to contribute to this
   work.\footnote{With less jubilation, I also expect that
   practitioners have new hard problems to contribute.
   With any luck, I will obtain more new solutions than new problems.}
\item \textbf{To enrich the educational experience for students.}
   All of the material contained in this set of works is free\footnote{Subject
   to license restrictions.  The license under which this book may be used
   is included later in this preface.  Software tools are licensed under the GPL.} (which,
   from a student's point of view, is the best price).  
   For example, this book can be used by instructors as
   free supplemental
   material for a course.
\item \textbf{To guide tool vendors.}  The design of tools
   is very much like the design of software, in that one must have
   a nearly complete understanding of the requirements
   in order to produce a useful product.  I have often found that
   tool vendors are unaware of the actual needs of embedded
   software developers.  By clearly enumerating requirements and
   lessons learned, I strive to give tool vendors the information
   and insight
   necessary to better support embedded software developers.
\end{itemize}

In \marginpar{\textbf{\emph{Small} Defined}}
the title of this book, I've indicated that this book is
about \index{small microcontroller system}\emph{small} microcontroller work.  By
\emph{small microcontroller work}, I mean the development
and production of small
embedded
software/hardware
systems such as are found
in consumer electronics and the automobile industry.  Although
it is difficult to specify precisely what is and is not a
\emph{small} microcontroller system, the systems
I have in mind generally meet
the following criteria.

\begin{itemize}
\item They
involve a single-chip control solution (the address and data busses of
the microcontroller are not extended outside the package).
\item They
involve ROM and RAM sizes of under 1M.\footnote{But usually much less--256K or less of ROM and 24K
or less of RAM would be typical for my definition of \emph{small}.}
\item They frequently involve non-preemptive scheduling.  In the systems I would
classify as \emph{small}, pre-emptive scheduling and/or commercial
RTOSs are relatively uncommon.
\item They involve a software
program that cannot easily be changed (either because the program
is lithographically masked into the microcontroller or because special
equipment or special access to the microcontroller is required).\footnote{A consequence of the
software unchangeability
combined with high production volumes is
that software mistakes are very, very expensive.}
\item They exist in an unstable electrical environment,
characterized by supply voltage fluctuations,
electrical transients, and spurious resets.
\end{itemize}

I use the term \index{hard problem}\emph{hard problem} throughout this book.
I define a
\marginpar{\textbf{\emph{Hard Problem} Defined}}
\emph{hard} problem as a problem that
meets the following two criteria.
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{The problem is \emph{hard}.}
         The time to solve the problem is measured in
         months or years, rather than hours or days; and furthermore,
         the problem may be beyond the analytical ability of
         most practicing embedded software engineers.  In practice, this means that
         an embedded software engineer cannot solve the problem in the time
         available during a product development cycle.
   \item \textbf{A solution to the problem is necessary for
         reliable software or for ease of software construction.}
         Generally, I would wish to exclude from consideration
         problems which are difficult but which have no practical implications
         for software reliability or ease of software construction
         if they are not solved.
\end{itemize}

Clearly, if an embedded software engineer is to be productive and
produce a reliable embedded product, the number of unsolved
\emph{hard} problems s/he encounters during a career must
be fairly small.  However, the reality is that a practicing
embedded software engineer encounters unsolved hard problems
on a daily basis.

In this work I take a special but not exclusive interest in
\emph{hard} problems---those that are relevant and necessary
but
so difficult and time-consuming that a software engineer cannot
solve them in the time available during the product development
cycle.  I also have some interest in paradigms (ways of
thinking about software systems and problems), and in
best and worst practices (practices that are likely to to
avert problems and practices that are nearly suicidal,
respectively).  It is noteworthy that I do not
have much interest in established
mathematical results that are available in
textbooks my readers probably already own.
For example, I have very limited interest in
reprinting the mathematical results surrounding
sampled control systems, but
I might be very interested in results predicting what
could and could not happen if such a
sampled control system is implemented on
a microcontroller using economical but lossy
multiplication and integration (to the best of my
knowledge, this insight does not exist anywhere).

\textbf{Part I:  Concepts}
\marginpar{\textbf{Book Contents}}
contains an introduction to the challenges of small microcontroller work.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cint0}, \cintzerotitle{}} explains the scope of the book 
      and what is meant by \emph{small microcontroller work}.
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{chgr0}, \chgrzerotitle{}} provides my personal 
      interpretation of the
      Holy Grail of embedded real-time software---that is, what is
      desirable and undesirable and what fundamental goals
      exist.  In this chapter, I deal primarily in paradigms of
      thought and
      unattainable goals.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Part II:  Mathematical Frameworks}
contains key mathematical frameworks and
results that are divorced from any specific problem.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cpri0}, \cprizerotitle{}} presents results surrounding
      properties of integers and prime and composite numbers.
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cfry0}, \cfryzerotitle{}} presents results surrounding
      the \index{Farey series}Farey series.  The Farey series, which is the 
      ordered set of rational numbers with a certain maximum denominator,
      forms the basis for some techniques of rational approximation.
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{ccfr0}, \ccfrzerotitle{}} presents results surrounding
      \index{continued fractions}continued fractions.  The apparatus of continued
      fractions provides the best algorithm for finding Farey neighbors and hence
      best rational approximations.
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cbal0}, \cbalzerotitle{}} presents results surrounding
      Boolean algebra.  Traditionally, Boolean algebra and the study of Boolean
      functions is associated with digital hardware design, but results and
      algorithms involving the simplification of Boolean functions also have
      application to the simplification of software control flow constructs.
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cqua0}, \cquazerotitle{}} presents results surrounding
      the analysis of calculation error introduced by \emph{quantization}, the
      unavoidable mapping from $\vworkrealset{}$ to $\vworkintset{}$ that must occur
      as signals from the external world, which are usually continuous in nature,
      are converted and processed by a microcontroller, which can inherently manipulate
      only integers.
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cmtn0}, \cmtnzerotitle{}} presents miscellaneous results
      from number theory which are useful or interesting, but awkward to
      categorize.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Part III:  Construction Of Embedded Software}
details the way embedded systems are (or should be)
constructed in practice.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cpco0}, \cpcozerotitle{}} outlines many aspects of
      the way that embedded software is constructed (or should be constructed) 
      in practice.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{csoc0}, \csoczerotitle{}} treats issues specific to 
      the support of peripherals that are usually located on the same silicon
      die as the microcontroller, such as hardware watchdogs or EEPROM.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{csoc1}, \csoconetitle{}} treats issues specific to 
      the support of peripherals that are usually separate from the microcontroller,
      such as transducers and actuators.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{csnc0}, \csnczerotitle{}} discusses the support
      of communication protocols and networks.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{csfo0}, \csfozerotitle{}} discusses requirements
      that tend to occur in many different types of embedded software,
      such as the need to calibrate an embedded product or diagnose it
      via a communication link.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{crta0}, \crtazerotitle{}} discusses the real-time
      analysis of embedded software; that is, how embedded software can be
      analyzed to be sure that it will always meet its real-time constraints.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Part IV:  Embedded System Algorithms And Techniques}
presents algorithms which are used in a target embedded system.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{ccil0}, \ccilzerotitle{}} presents
      classical and simple\footnote{Here \emph{classical} is used
	  in the same sense as Knuth uses it in \cite[p. 265]{bibref:b:knuthclassic2ndedvol2}.} 
	  integer algorithms and techniques which 
      are used in embedded systems.  Because integer and fixed point algorithms
      are the dominant paradigm of arithmetic in small microcontroller
      systems, this chapter is the backbone of most arithmetic in these systems.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{crat0}, \cratzerotitle{}} develops techniques
      and results surrounding rational approximation; that is, arpproximating a real number
      $r_I$ by a rational number $h/k$.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cdta0}, \cdtazerotitle{}} presents algorithms
      for use in discrete time (such as integration and differentiation),
      and also more sophisticated integer algorithms.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cnnu0}, \cnnuzerotitle{}} presents miscellaneous
      non-numerical algorithms for use in target embedded systems.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Part V:  Practical, Administrative, Incidental, And Miscellaneous Topics}
discusses topics that are non-technical, only peripherally related to embedded system
software development,
or difficult to categorize elsewhere.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cmpd0}, \cmpdzerotitle{}} discusses practical technqiues for
      the management of materials produced during the product development process.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cpit0}, \cpitzerotitle{}} provides designs and some
      analysis of circuits that are useful in microcontroller software 
	  development---either in microcontroller products themselves or in
	  test fixtures.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cbma0}, \cbmazerotitle{}} discusses
      bad management and unpleasant work situations, provides paradigms
      and strategies for dealing with unpleasant work situations, and provides
	  guidance in finding employment.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cpxf0}, \cpxfzerotitle{}} describes software and
      hardware products which are exceptionally useful in embedded product development.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{corq0}, \corqzerotitle{}} describes open research
      questions, i.e. problems I am aware of but do not know how to solve.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cisk0}, \ciskzerotitle{}} contains reverse analyses of 
      embedded product defects, and the lessons to be learned from these 
	  defects.\footnote{The word \emph{Insektengericht} (``insect court'', in German)
	  comes from a page in a \emph{Beavis and Butthead} comic book purchsed in 
	  the M\"unchen Hauptbahnhoff around 1996.  In this comic book, Beavis and 
	  Butthead sit in judgement of insects (bugs), always with the verdict 
	  \emph{schuldig} (guilty), and always with harsh sentences such as 
	  \emph{Tod durch explodieren} (death by explosion).  I do much the same 
	  thing with embedded software bugs and embedded product defects.}
	  Because it isn't possible in the product development process to address
	  \emph{every} possible source of defect, I feel it is important to
	  have a visceral feel for what is most likely to go wrong; and such
	  intuition can only come from actively collecting product defects.  I very much
	  hope that airline pilots study transcripts and reports from airplane crashes, and I
	  encourage embedded software developers to do the same.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Part VI:  ESRG Tool Set Reference Guide}
is a reference for the research tool set for microcontroller 
work (based on Tcl/Tk from Scriptics/Ajuba/Interwoven), which is packaged
with this book.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{ctin0}, \ctinzerotitle{}} contains an overview
      of the tool set and its design goals and construction.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{ctcm0}, \ctcmzerotitle{}} provides a reference
      for the Tcl scripting language, around which the tool set is constructed.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{ctkm0}, \ctkmzerotitle{}} provides a reference
      for the Tk graphical extensions to Tcl.  These graphical extensions,
	  which are built into the tool set, are very useful for providing
	  attractive GUI interfaces.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cfaq0}, \cfaqzerotitle{}} addresses frequently
      asked questions and ``gotchas'' in Tcl and Tk.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cxtn0}, \cxtnzerotitle{}} documents the Tcl
      extensions which have been added to the script interpreters
	  (\emph{EsrgScripter} and \emph{EsrgConsole}).  These extensions form the
	  ``meat'' of \emph{The ESRG Tool Set}, and represent the new ideas or
	  new effort we are trying to convey.  These new ideas and
      new effort are embedded into  Tcl interpreters to grant
	  greater flexibility in their application.

\item \textbf{Chapter\;\ref{cdcm0}, \cdcmzerotitle{}} documents the DOS command-line
      utilities packaged with the tool set.  In many cases, these utilities
	  perform functions identical or similar to Tcl extensions, but there are advantages to
	  packaging functionality as a DOS command-line utility.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Part VIII:  Solutions To Selected Exercises}
contains solutions for selected exercises
found throughout the work.

Although \marginpar{\textbf{Features For Readers}} I
know that all of my readers will be involved in some way
with technical things---such as mathematics, computer science,
control theory, software quality, or the design and development
of embedded products---I realize that my readers will
vary in what they are trying to obtain from the work.  Some readers
will be very research oriented, and may be trying to solve or pose
a particular hard problem.
Other readers may be looking for a specific practical
solution.

For the more practical reader, I have tried to be complete--that
is, I have tried not to omit information that might be
necessary in understanding my work without additional
research effort.  In addition, a rich set of helpful materials is
packaged with \emph{The ESRG Tool Set} installation.

For the more research-oriented reader, I have tried to allow the
reader to rapidly find books, technical papers, Web sites,
technical experts,
and researchers.  For this reason, books, papers,
Web sites, and individuals
are all cited and referenced using the same
framework in the bibliography.  This means the
reader is directed not only to technical documents,
but also to the authors of the
documents.

Since \marginpar{\textbf{Version Identification}}
this book will be maintained on the Web, the issue arises of how
a reader would know one version of this book from another.
I have provided two mechanisms for this.\footnote{\TeX{}
tradition would demand that I pick a transcendental number
and with each successive version reveal another decimal place,
but that is too much work for me, given that
version control systems will handle the task automatically.}

\begin{itemize}

   \item The title page indicates when the work was compiled from
   \LaTeX{} source code.  Two copies of the work with the
   same compile date are almost certainly identical.

   \item The entire work is maintained under a version control
   system (CVS at \emph{SourceForge}),
   \index{CVS}\index{SourceForge} and I've included
   keyword expansions near the end of the \LaTeX{} source files so that version
   control information is included automatically in the document text (for example,
   a block of version control information is at the end of each chapter).
   Sections or chapters with the same version control information are almost certainly
   identical.

I \marginpar{\textbf{Intellectual Property}} believe very
strongly in the notion of intellectual property.  I have endeavored
in this book to cite all references and to identify all work and
all ideas that are not my own.\footnote{I've actually gone a step
further---I've tried to provide enough information to allow a
motivated reader to get in touch with the originator of the work
or ideas.}  I would request the same courtesy in return (but will
not enforce this courtesy, except by exposure of parties responsible
for the theft of ideas without credit).  Plagiarism and theft of intellectual property is a 
regrettable but common occurrence, and I can
reliably predict that some student somewhere in the Webbed world
will borrow my ideas or work without citation
for a semester project---such events would earn my scorn 
but be relatively insignificant
on my radar screen.  However, if any of my work appears without
credit in academic journals, I would take the matter less
jovially and would very likely report the plagiarism to the journal 
involved.

I \marginpar{\textbf{Contacting the Author}}\index{contacting the author}
